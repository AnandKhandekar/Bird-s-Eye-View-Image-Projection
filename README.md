# Bird-s-Eye-View-Image-Projection
The imaging plane or the camera plane is a 2D projection of 3D world coordinates therefore, the spatial relationship between the objects in this plane changes due to camera perspective. The objects near to the camera appear larger than those that are away from it. Calculating the distance between the rectangles in this perspective would give an incorrect estimate of the actual distance, we must correct it by transforming the image into top-down-view or birdâ€™s-eye-view. This is done by applying an Inverse Perspective Transform onto the image.
